# Next.js: Blank Screen or Loading Indicator with Slow API Call

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where a slow API call on a page can lead to a blank screen or a loading indicator that never disappears. This is because Next.js renders the page on the server-side, and if the API call takes too long, the page renders without the data, and the loading state might not be properly handled.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` component simulates a slow API call using `setTimeout`.  When the API call takes more than a few seconds, it might cause the user to see a blank screen or an incomplete loading experience.  The user should see a loading indicator while the API call is in progress, and then the data once the API call is complete.

## Solution

The provided solution in `pages/aboutSolution.js` implements proper error handling and loading state management.  It uses a loading state and checks if the data is `null` before rendering the content. This approach prevents a blank screen or a perpetually loading indicator.  The `useEffect` hook ensures that the API call is triggered only once when the component mounts.
